  abstract={This paper presents a general design methodology to optimally select the ratings of step-up transformers for grid connected Wind Turbine Generators on the basis of the statistical distribution of the wind energy and the mathematical model of the plant. The methodology exploits a probabilistic approach based on the evaluation of the so called LPPP (Loss of Produced Power Probability) index. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Discount Payback Period (PBP) can be computed from the results of the LPPP analysis and exploited to detect the most advantageous solution.},

abstract = {An increase in electricity demand and renewable penetration requires electrical utilities to improve and optimize the grid infrastructure. Fundamental components in this grid infrastructure are transformers, which are designed conservatively based on static rated power. However, load and weather change continuously and hence, transformers are not used most efficiently. For this reason, new technology has been developed: Dynamic transformer rating (DTR). Applying DTR makes it possible to load transformers above the nameplate rating without affecting their lifetime expectancy. This study uses DTR for short-term and long-term wind farm planning. The optimal wind farm is designed by applying DTR to the power transformer and using it as an input to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Regarding the transformer thermal analysis, the linearized top oil model of IEEE Clause 7 is selected. The model is executed for 4 different types of power transformers: 63 MVA, 100 MVA, 200 MVA and 400 MVA. As a result, it is obtained that the net present value for the investment and the capacity of the wind farm increase linearly with respect to the size of the transformer. Then, a sensitivity analysis is carried out by modifying the wind speed, the electricity price, the lifetime of the transformer and the selected weather data. From this sensitivity analysis, it is possible to conclude that wind resources and electricity price are critical parameters for the wind farm’s feasibility.}

This document applies to the transformer used to connect the wind turbine generator to the wind farm power collection system or adjacent distribution network and not the transformer used to connect several wind turbines to a distribution or transmission network. Transformers covered by this document comply with the relevant requirements prescribed in the IEC 60076 standards or IEEE C57 standards},
